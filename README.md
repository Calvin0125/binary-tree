# binary-tree

This is my implementation of a binary-tree in Ruby. First I added methods to build the tree and insert and delete values. 
Then, I added methods for breadth first and depth first(preorder, inorder, and postorder)traversal of the tree. I also added methods 
to check the height, check if it is balanced, and rebalance the tree after adding values that cause it to be unbalanced. This functionality
can be shown by the driver script which displays output in the command line.
